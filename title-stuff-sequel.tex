% (1) Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

% - Joe: Wanted to walk through the PoP paper with Rebecca, in order to help solidify my own grasp of the concepts and get her feedback.
% - Rebecca: This topic sounded interesting when you mentioned it and I wanted to learn about Pop

% (2) Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?

% - Indeed we did speed through the paper, Rebecca pointed out a few places where there was friction with the wording or concepts, like ``PEER-TO-PEER'' and also suggested Operational Research and Strategy as an appropriate topic; mentioned “improvisatory” style
% - Interruptions were welcomed!
% - Rebecca: was hesitant to interrupt the narrative
% - This is a bit different from usual IEAI style...

% (3) What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?

% - Joe: appreciate the time Rebecca has put into this a lot, and I also think this was a good way to present the paper
% - Rebecca: I think you assume knowledge in the presentation, and I think you need to assume the listener (if they aren’t in the area) that they don’t know anything.  It wouldn’t be patronising to explain the basic concepts.

% (4) What did we learn or change?

% - Talking to Karl, he would reconise one of the areas (probably) but not necessarily the other two.  Everyone is going to be new to some of these concepts.
% - This was great as a ``final edit'' — we will also be able to edit this paper until December
% - RR: is it your aim to automate?

% (5) What else should we change going forward?

% - Joe: if it would be helpful to RR, I’d certainly be happy to meet again about these ideas
% - Would this (patterns of patterns) to actually be useful for ethical AI?
% - E.g., rethink in the context of moral machines

\begin{abstract}
Building on earlier installments, this paper re-examines the PLACARD
pattern.  We report on a series of workshops where PLACARD was used to
scaffold collaborative reflection, speculative inquiry, and stimulate
design pattern generation. These accounts are enriched by a comparison
case: virtual workshops carried out with simple AI-based chatbots.  We
discuss limitations and lessons learned from both the human and
multi-agent settings.  We conclude by outlining a future development
strategy at the intersection of AI agents, design patterns, and
institutional governance.

%% COMMENT: (Charlotte) "How used in the real world?
%% COMMENT: (Joe) "Excellent question.  We could just say "not used outside of our workshops" — but actually, we use variations of the patterns that we describe in this paper in our collaborations (in the peeragogy project and beyond).  It would be great to have a short summary of such uses and indeed, that could go into the abstract; but, we'll have to work on it!"
